# Norway expenditures dashboard in Excel ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´
This repository contains a dashboard built in Excel.
The project is part of my portfolio with the goal of combining pivot-based analytics and storytelling.

## Overview
The dashboard provides a general overview of health expenditures by financing sources.

## Key Features
- Pivot Charts â€“ visualizing trends and breakdowns by source of financing
- Pivot Table â€“ embedded directly into the dashboard to allow interactive filtering of results
- Storytelling elements â€“ each visualization is summarized to highlight key insights

## Data Notes
- Missing values for HF.1.1.1 and HF.1.1.2 in years 2021â€“2022. This does not significantly affect the analysis, since both are components of HF.1.1.
- The total health expenditure is calculated as **HF.1 + HF.2â€“4**, since the remaining categories are simply subcomponents of HF.1.
